        <!-- Artist Bio -->
        <div class="artist-bio">
            <p>Portspeed (early known as 'M4RCOS') was a Content Creator on YouTube for a very long time and very early on his life, but later by the end of 2023, he announced he would be quitting doing Content Creating videos, fully abandoning his old channel.</p>

            <p>In 2020, he started doing Dubs from popular Brazillian Songs, with his first EP being 'mundo_dos_dubs'. In 2021, he began producing his own sound, which lead to his first original EP 'Factory'. At the same year, he began producing his biggest and most ambicious project to date, 'ЯƎVƎЯOꟻ'. It was produced in a period of 15 months and it was released on the 8th of July, 2022.</p>

            <p>After 'ЯƎVƎЯOꟻ', Portspeed began making more music, but way different from the sound he made on 'ЯƎVƎЯOꟻ', which began on 'Audio Files' EP, that later lead to the making of his Mixtape 'Trash Bin', made in roughly a week.</p>
            
            <p>Currently, Portspeed is now part of 'HC402 Records', owned by his friend 'Hypercat420'. There's still no planned future releases from Portspeed, but it is likely that his next thing could be a Deluxe Version of 'Factory' EP, since he already released new versions from 'Default Loop', 'Electromagnetic Machine' and 'The Longest', songs that are present in 'Factory' EP.</p>
